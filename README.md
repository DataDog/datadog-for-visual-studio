# Datadog extension for Visual Studio

## Overview

The Datadog extension for Visual Studio helps you to improve software performance by providing meaningful code-level insights in the IDE based on real-time observability data. Together with the Continuous Profiler, the plugin helps you to reduce latency and lower cloud costs by highlighting code lines that:

* Consume the most CPU
* Allocate the most memory
* Spend the most time on locks, disk I/O, socket I/O, and more

## Requirements

* Visual Studio 2022 (version 17 or later)
* Datadog account. Don't have an account? [sign up for a free trial](https://www.datadoghq.com/lpg/)
* To display code-level insights, the plugin requires Continuous Profiling instrumented on your .NET services. For more information, see [Getting started with Continuous Profiler](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/profiler/)
